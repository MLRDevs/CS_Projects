			Olympus Has Fallen
		</h1>
		<img src="olympushasfallen.jpg">
			<p>
				This movie has always been one of my favorites. <br>
				Mainly beause of the fact that this movie has a lot of action in it.<br>
				This movie also puts a realistic aspect on the<br>
				United States feud with North Korea, as North Korea<br>
				takes down the White House in this movie. Also in this movie <br>
				it shows how hard it is to have jobs in the White House and actually <br>
				work for the government as the members of government get caputered<br>
				and asked their specific codes for nuclear missiles. In this movie there;s <br>
				also shown secret tunnels and facts about the White House in general which<br>
				I find quite interesting.

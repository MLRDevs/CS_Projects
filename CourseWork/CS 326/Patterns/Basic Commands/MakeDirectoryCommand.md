# Make Directory

*Forces*: creating directories helps us be more organized with a lot of different files

*Solution*: the mkdir command allows you to create a directory to put files into in order to be more organized with your work

```
cd Desktop          // change the current working directory to the Desktop
mkdir WorkStuff     // create the directory "WorkStuff"
ls                  // look at the list of everything in the current working directory to make sure it worked
```

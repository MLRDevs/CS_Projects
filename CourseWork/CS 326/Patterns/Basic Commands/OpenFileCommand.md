# Open File

*Forces*: when working with files, you would want to edit the contents of them and make any changes you need

*Solution*: the open file command allows you to open the file and make any necessary changes to the file

```
cd Desktop                      // Change the current working directory to the desktop
ls                              // use the list command to see what files are in the desktop
gopen file.txt                  // opens the file "file.txt" in a default application
gopen -a Textpad MyFile.py      // use the -a option to specify what application to open the file
```

# Git Commit

*Forces*: you want to save all of your changes and push it to the respository

*Solution*: using git commit on the command line, that pushes all of your changes to the repository

```
git commit          // commits everything in the current directory
git commit -m       // adds a message to the commit to see what was changed
git log             // command to see all of the commits made, used to make sure it was commited
```

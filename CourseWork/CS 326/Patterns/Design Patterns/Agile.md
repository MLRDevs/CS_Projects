# Agile Design

*Forces*: When designing programs and applications, it can be difficult to keep it all organized and what needs to be worked on and responsibiliy for those activities

*Solution*: Agile is desinged to work on whichever activity needs to be worked on at any given moment. It works very well with feedback from the customer in order to fix or work on what needs to be worked on without working on things that don't need to be worked on.

### Structure and Set of Practices
These are the activites that break down creating an application:
* Analyze
* Designe
* Code
* Test
* Release

<br>

### Agile Values
These are the values that come with using the agile design:
* courage
* respect
* communication
* feedback
* simplicity

<br>

using this pattern, there is a for sure way for the customer to get exactly what the customer wants. Whatever needs to be changed can be changed in a very organized way. This sets the tone for the team that develops the application to exactly what is asked of them.

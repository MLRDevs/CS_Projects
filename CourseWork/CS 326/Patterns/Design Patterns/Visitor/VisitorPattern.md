# Visitor Pattern

*Forces*: It is an issue to go to the class to define a new method everytime

*Solution*: The Visior Pattern has a seperate visitor object that traverses throughout a data structure and does the method to the right object

### The following example will use C++
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

public class visitor {
    
};
```

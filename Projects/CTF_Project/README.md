# CTF Project
This is one of the projects that I am most proud in. This was orignally a project for a software engineering course which then developed into me and my friend Jordan's senior project. It involves a website and server with Javascript and NodeJS that manipulates Docker containers for a Capture The Flag (CTF) exercise for cyber security.

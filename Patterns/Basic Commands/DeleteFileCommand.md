*Forces*: sometimes you don't need a certain file anymore and want to delete it from your machine

*Solution*: the delete file command allows you to delete certain files from your machine

```
cd Desktop                  // change the current working directory to the Desktop
mkdir oldstuff              // create a new directory
cp oldfile.txt oldstuff     // copy the file "oldfile.txt" to the new directory just created
rm oldfile.txt              // remove the file "oldfile.txt" from the current working directory
ls                          // use the list command to make sure "oldfile.txt" is no longer there
```

# Python
This folder includes different python projects I have worked on. I have done many python projects while I was learning with an online textbook. None of that is my own work so it is not pushed here. Below are two main projects that I have worked on:

### Reddit Bot
This project uses Reddit's API to create a video of a post. The python code webscrapes a specific subreddit and takes that text and inputs into a text file. Once that is done, an .mp3 file is then created which is an AI voice reading that text file. Combine that with stock footage and puts it all into a final .mp4 file. This project was intended to go further but I haven't had the time.

### Movie DB 
This project is not in the repository but is useful. This project entailed scrapping movie websites to create a massive spreadsheet of movies to watch that another script then was able to search through based on title, genre, length, etc. It is not in the repository as it currently doesn't work in it's current state. This project was also years ago and the practices I used in that project do not reflect how I program today.

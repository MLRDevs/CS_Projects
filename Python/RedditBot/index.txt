I think my school rigged our votes.


Ok I've never wrote anything here but to start I'm 18. I'm still a senior in highschool and have always been active. This is about homecoming and prom. My school doesn't actually have a prom queen but something similar where the school does multiple different votes to choose. I was nominated to try for the queen by teachers. About 40 girls and 40 boys are nominated. We were sopposed to fill out a form, which would give us points based off how much we have done at school. This only included clubs and things like band and sports. It asked how many years and if you were in a leadership position such as an officer of any kind. I got pretty excited because my entire sophomore and junior year I worked really hard to be vice-president of 3 clubs in the school and I was in 2 more as well as band. I know my peers and I figured I really only had one or 2 other girls who did about this much. I figured I was garenteed for the top 10 vote with our underclassmen.

To clarify the voting was sopposed to be like this:
•nominated by a teacher
•top 10 choose based on points in a form
•top 5 choose by all students
•finally queen and king choose by teachers

I figured the hardest part for me would be the students or maybe the teachers but the list came out for voting yesterday. I wasnt on it. I did get kinda bummed out about it but because I was hanging out with some friends I tried not to think about it. Well last night I just couldn't stop thinking about it. One of the girls on the list was a friend of mine, so I just plain asked her about her involvement in the school and how much she had done. She is only in 3 of the clubs and in one leadership position. After that I started thinking that maybe I messed up my form and they disqualified me for it, like I clicked by accident since the form said something about lieing would get you disqualified immediately. But that doesn't add up either because I was so paranoid about doing that during the form that I went over it a few times. 

Ok whatever I didn't get our prom queen thing. But there was another incident like this in the early fall for homecoming. Each of the fall sports, including band, sends 2 girls to be on the homecoming court. I didn't want to be homecoming queen and there has never been a band girl as homecoming queen, especially since that vote is made by football for some reason. But still I wanted to wear the dress and stand up there. I had talked to all my friends in band and I had a very good reputation with my underclassmen. the band is about 80 kids and I was good friends with at least 20. A lot didn't want to be in it and so they said they would give their vote to me. I spent about a week getting as many people to vote for me as I could. I had about 50-60 people say they wanted to vote for me and that they would. The day in band came and only about 6 girls were on the list. Everyone can only choose 2. A ton of people kept coming up to me in band saying they voted for me and usually the same 3 other girls. By the end of band that day I thought the running was down to me and what seemed pretty even for 2 other girls and one more just above in votes than the last 2 who didn't really get any at all. 

Fast forward to the next week where we announced who won, it was one of the girls I thought would win in 2 or 3 just like the people said but everyone was surprised when one of the girls who got almost no votes earlier had won. I didn't think much of it again at first but the next day I started asking questions. The other girl who had almost no votes was our drum major. Pretty much our band directors second set of hands. She seemed upset and I asked her. She said it didn't seem right. She said I was sopposed to win and she felt like she wasnt even if in the running. She wanted to know the votes. In the past they had always been released in the form of a pie chart. We always used Google forms so it was easier and couldn't be messed up. However she couldn't get the band directors to release it this time around. 

You wouldn't think much of this and think that everyone just lied to me until I tell you that the girl who surprised us by getting to the homecoming court was rich. She has a long legacy in the school where her older sister was on the court too. Her mom runs our bands funding. Her sister and her brother where both drum line section leaders in the past too. I asked a few people their opinion on it and they said it wasn't fair but there was nothing we can do. 

I don't particularly feel like doing anything about these since the school year is almost done but I'm still kinda sad about it. I just want people to know. If I made something hard to understand please tell me and I'll try to rephrase it for you. Thanks for listening to me.

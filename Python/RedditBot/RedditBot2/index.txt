"I can't give you my birthday! Someone could steal my identity!"

a couple months ago, a store I work at implemented in, that for all products that require you to be 18 and over to buy, you must now put down a month day and year when another store that was owned by the company I work for was caught selling cigarettes for minors and got fined 50k and loss their license to sell lottery and tobacco for 5 years, and they did not want to risk that happening agian.

It is annoying, but most customers understand why after we tell them, and we just ask for a year if they are clearly over 30, is it stupid to ask when we can tell?  Yes, but it is what the company wants, and most got use to it, and understand.

this brings me to this guy who wanted some tickets, and we asked him for his birthday (this was still early on so we asked for the full date instead of just the year) and he refused to give it too us, his reason being that someone could hear him and use his birthday as a way to steal his identity.  After a bit the manager came and ended up just selling him the lottery just to get him to leave,

That whole thing confused us all and all the customers there, mainly because a day month and year gives you nothing to work on.  thousands of people are born on the same day you are, so anyone who tries to use that would face a giant wall and give up.  I don;t know if he needed to think of a reason to not want to say when he was born, or if he actually believes that someone could use that to steal someones identity, but it was just such a silly thing to get mad about.
